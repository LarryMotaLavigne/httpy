# HTTPy Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the HTTPy project, a simple and intuitive HTTP server library for Python. The plan is organized into phases, with each phase focusing on specific aspects of the project.

## Phase 1: Core HTTP/1.1 Server Implementation

### 1.1 Project Setup
- Set up project structure
- Create basic package layout
- Set up development environment
- Configure testing framework
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

### 1.2 HTTP/1.1 Protocol Implementation
- Implement request parsing
- Implement response generation
- Support for common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement header handling
- Implement connection keep-alive

### 1.3 Routing System
- Implement decorator-based routing
- Support for path parameters
- Support for query parameters
- Implement route matching algorithm

### 1.4 Request and Response Handling
- Implement request object
- Implement response object
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Content type handling
- Status code management

### 1.5 Error Handling
- Implement error response generation
- Exception handling
- Logging system

## Phase 2: Advanced Protocol Support

### 2.1 WebSocket Implementation
- WebSocket handshake
- WebSocket message framing
- WebSocket connection management
- Event-based WebSocket API

### 2.2 HTTP/2.0 Implementation
- HTTP/2.0 frame handling
- Header compression
- Stream multiplexing
- Server push
- Prioritization
- Upgrade mechanism from HTTP/1.1

### 2.3 HTTP/3.0 Implementation
- QUIC protocol integration (using aioquic)
- HTTP/3.0 frame handling
- Connection management
- Fallback mechanism when aioquic is not available

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization

### 3.1 Benchmarking
- Set up benchmarking framework
- Define performance metrics
- Implement benchmark scenarios
- Compare with other frameworks (Starlette, Flask)

### 3.2 Optimization
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize request parsing
- Optimize routing algorithm
- Optimize connection handling
- Memory usage optimization

### 3.3 Concurrency Improvements
- Optimize async handling
- Connection pooling
- Resource management

## Phase 4: Deployment and Documentation

### 4.1 Docker Support
- Create Dockerfile
- Multi-stage build process
- Multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64)
- Multi-Python version support (3.9-3.13)

### 4.2 Documentation
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Installation guide
- Advanced usage scenarios
- Performance tuning guide

### 4.3 Testing and Quality Assurance
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Performance tests
- Security tests
- Cross-platform testing

## Phase 5: Security and Reliability

### 5.1 Security Enhancements
- HTTPS/TLS support
- Input validation
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Security best practices

### 5.2 Reliability Improvements
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Graceful shutdown
- Resource cleanup
- Stability under high load
