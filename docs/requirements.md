# HTTPy Requirements

## Overview
HTTPy is a simple, intuitive HTTP server library for Python that aims to provide a clean and efficient interface for creating HTTP servers with minimal dependencies. This document outlines the requirements and specifications for the HTTPy project.

## Functional Requirements

### Core HTTP Server
1. Implement an asynchronous HTTP server with minimal dependencies
2. Support for HTTP/1.1 protocol
3. Support for common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
4. Decorator-based routing system for defining endpoints
5. Path parameter extraction from URLs
6. Query parameter parsing
7. JSON request and response handling
8. Connection keep-alive support
9. Proper error handling and status codes

### Advanced Protocol Support
1. WebSocket support for real-time bidirectional communication
2. HTTP/2.0 support with:
   - Header compression
   - Multiplexing
   - Server push
   - Prioritization
3. HTTP/3.0 support with QUIC protocol (when aioquic is available)

### Performance Requirements
1. Efficient handling of concurrent connections
2. Low memory footprint
3. Fast response times
4. Comparable performance to other popular Python web frameworks (Starlette, Flask)

### Deployment Requirements
1. Docker support for containerized deployment
2. Multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64)
3. Support for multiple Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
1. Simple, intuitive API for developers
2. Comprehensive documentation with examples
3. Clear error messages

### Maintainability
1. Well-structured, modular codebase
2. Comprehensive test coverage
3. Consistent coding style
4. Proper documentation of code

### Reliability
1. Stable under high load
2. Graceful handling of errors
3. Proper resource cleanup

### Security
1. Protection against common web vulnerabilities
2. Support for HTTPS/TLS
3. Proper input validation

## Constraints
1. Compatible with Python 3.9 and above
2. Minimal external dependencies
3. Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
